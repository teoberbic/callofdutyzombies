                <h2>Overview of Story (for Beginners)</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, there were only the Aether and Keepers. Among them were two beings who would later be known by many names. One would be known as Doctor Monty, the other being as the Shadowman. In time, the Keepers crafted the Summoning Key, a device that allows them to manipulate the Aether. Holding power over reality itself, they used it to create Agartha. The Keepers later mastered the ability to travel between dimensions.
    
                    At some point, several Keepers, among which the Shadowman, began experimenting with the Dark Aether, an energy beneath creation. The Dark Aether corrupted and corroded their souls, and the corrupted Keepers became known as the Apothicons.
                    
                    The Apothicons created the Aether Pyramid, a device capable of absolute power. A schism formed between them and the Keepers untainted by the Dark Aether. Soon after, a war broke out between Apothicons and uncorrupted Keepers. Facing defeat, the Apothicons hid the Aether Pyramid on a moon within one of the newly discovered dimensions. After banishing the Apothicons to the Dark Aether, the remaining Keepers took on the mantle of Guardians. Trapped in the Dark Aether, the Apothicons evolved over eons into twisted creatures that now bear little resemblance to their Keeper brethren. They desired, above all else, to return to Agartha.
                    
                    By September 5 CE, the Apothicons, knowing the Earth has a gateway to Agartha, sent meteors containing Element 115 to the planet in different dimensions across space and time. They believe humanity will one day use Element 115 to wage war among themselves, opening a rift that will allow the Apothicons to escape the Dark Aether.</p>
